Day-1-task/Q.No:1> Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP/1.1 being the most widely used version of the protocol. With the increasing demand for faster and more efficient web applications,
HTTP/2 was introduced. HTTP/2 is more efficiency and speed compare to HTTP/1.1.(example:HTTP/2 has the latest technology like Multiplexing, 
Header Compression, Server Push, Binary Protocol in these departments the HTTP/2 has more advantage to use.)
In multiplex HTTP/1.1 uses a single connection to transfer a single file at a time. On the other hand the HTTP/2, uses a technique called multiplexing, 
where multiple requests can be sent and received on the same connection at the same time.
In header compression the HTTP/2 has high speed page loading compare to HTTP/1.1 HTTP/2 supports server push,
where the server can proactively push resources to the client before the client requests them.

Q.NO:2> Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
In JavaScript, everything is an object. From simple data types like strings and numbers, to complex data structures like arrays and functions, 
all are represented as objects. Objects in Javascript are essentially containers that hold properties and methods.
The internal representation of an object in javascript is based on a key-value pair model. That each property of an object is stored as a key-value pair.
The key is a string that serves as the identifier for the property, while the value can be any data type.
